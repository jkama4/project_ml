# Heart Disease Risk - Neural Network and Traditional ML Models
This is the repository for our machine learning project. The purpose of this research is to compare a neural network to traditional machine learning models, specifically s log regression model, linear SVM, and decision tree. The data set used is a kaggle data set which can be found at:

For more information regarding the project, we'll refer to the 'final_report.pdf'.

## Requirements
To set up your environment, we recommend using a conda environment with Python 3.10+.

If you follow the instructions below step by step, you should be all set up.

```python
conda create --name myenv python=3.12
```

To activate your environment anytime, use

```python
conda activate myenv
```

The following command will install all necessary packages

```python
conda install pandas numpy matplotlib sklearn
```

You should now be set up. 

For future projects, my personal recommendation would be to use poetry. This allows for easier and more efficient management of your packages. You can find the docs at https://python-poetry.org/docs/
